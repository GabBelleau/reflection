	1) Why should I do that, Let see. One cool thing is the usage of diff in the commnad line
2) I need be the terminal pro
3) getting there

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	very useful


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	using dropbox (it keep only 30 days)
	google docs 
	Personnal one could use time machine on mac


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Cons is that you are dependent of humain mistake
	pros is that you can logically manage it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	first git is really focus around version of programmation, in programmation it is important to understand that one change can affect many components file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	simple using git log to find your commit
	and then using git diff that will list all the difference between the two log id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	like time capsule it take version of different file between each commit, and it is up to the programmer to make the commit.
